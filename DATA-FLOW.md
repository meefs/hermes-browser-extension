# Data Flow

Hermes Browser Extension connects browser context to the Hermes Agent runtime you configure. This document describes the shipped v0.1.9 data flow.

## Connection modes

### Local Hermes API

Default Gateway URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8642
```

In local mode, context is sent from the extension to the Hermes Gateway/API server running on the same machine.

### Remote Hermes API

When you configure a remote Gateway URL and API key/browser token, context is sent to that remote Hermes API server. Same-LAN or private VPN hosts can use `http://host:8642`; public/proxied hosts should use `https://`. Set `API_SERVER_ENABLED=true`, `API_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `API_SERVER_KEY`, and a narrow `API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://<extension-id>` on the Hermes host. Do not expose a Hermes API server naked to the public internet.

### Remote dashboard WebSocket

When remote mode has a dashboard URL and no API key, the extension uses the signed-in dashboard tab to mint a single-use WebSocket ticket and connects to the dashboard socket. In this mode, REST-only features such as profile list and image upload can be unavailable.

## What can be sent to Hermes

Depending on context scope, settings, and page availability, a turn can include:

- user message typed into the composer
- active tab title and URL for the followed or pinned context tab
- selected text
- readable page text
- page metadata, headings, form labels, links, buttons, and interactive element labels where available
- open tab titles/URLs when “Include open tabs” is enabled, or selected open-tab summaries when you use the tab picker
- YouTube transcript text when a transcript provider is enabled and available
- attached text files or metadata for non-text files
- pasted/attached images as inline data, or as a local path when the connected Hermes runtime advertises image upload support
- voice transcript text from Hermes STT or Browser speech fallback
- selected model/session/profile/settings metadata needed to route the request

If you choose **Chat only**, the extension sends your message without active tab title/URL, open tabs, selected text, page metadata, YouTube transcript, or page text.

## What Hermes saw receipt

v0.1.9 includes a collapsible “What Hermes saw” receipt after each sent turn. It summarizes:

- context scope, including Chat only when no browser context was attached
- active tab
- pinned tab when applicable
- whether selected text was included
- page text character count
- whether a YouTube transcript was included
- open tab count and the number of tabs actually sent to Hermes
- attachment counts
- redaction count

This receipt is for transparency and debugging. It is generated locally by the extension from the outgoing context.

## Tool activity while streaming

When Hermes reports a tool call during a streaming turn, v0.1.9 renders it as an in-message Tool Activity Strip with a sanitized short preview. Tool names and previews are generated locally from normalized runtime events; sensitive token shapes are redacted before display. Tool activity is UI state only and is not extra browser context sent to Hermes.

## Redaction and untrusted context

Before page text is sent to Hermes, the extension redacts common secret/token shapes such as bearer tokens, provider API keys, private keys, GitHub tokens, Slack tokens, JWTs, and common `key=value` secret assignments.

Before tab titles/URLs are included in the prompt, v0.1.9 redacts restricted categories such as browser internals, banking, crypto wallets, password managers, checkout/payment, health, and government tax/account pages.

Browser page content is wrapped as untrusted context in the prompt. Hermes is instructed not to follow instructions from the page unless the human user explicitly asks.

## Capability detection

The extension reads `/v1/capabilities` when available. If an older Hermes runtime does not expose that endpoint, v0.1.9 enters legacy compatibility mode:

- core chat/session features are attempted when the Gateway is connected and authenticated
- browser-specific routes such as audio transcription, browser pairing, profile list, and image upload stay in fallback/manual mode unless advertised

v0.1.9 also separates gateway reachability from upstream Hermes runtime/tool tracebacks. If the API server is reachable but an upstream Hermes tool/runtime raises a Python traceback, the side panel can show a connected-with-warning diagnostic instead of treating the whole Browser connection as broken. Settings also include Copy Diagnostics, which creates a redacted support block without API keys, bearer tokens, cookies, page text, selected text, tab titles, or full tab URLs.
