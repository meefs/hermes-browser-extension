# Changelog

## v0.1.8 — 2026-07-04

### Active-run chat steering
- Added active-run chat steering from the composer: while Hermes is running, Enter on a text draft steers the active turn, with explicit Queue/Steer/Stop controls in the busy composer.
- Wired the Browser side panel to `/v1/runs/{run_id}/steer` for local API mode and `session.steer` over the dashboard WebSocket for remote-dashboard mode.
- Added a pure `busyComposerSubmitAction()` helper with regressions: text-only active draft + steer available → steer; attachments or no steer → queue; empty → ignore.
- Added a pure `shouldAutoFlushQueuedTurn()` helper so backend-queued steer fallbacks never auto-send as a normal next prompt.
- Surfaced backend `steer.queued` events: the draft returns to the composer with an explicit "Steer not injected" status instead of pretending the steer was applied or queueing it for after the turn.
- Updated steer success copy to "Steer sent to active run" so the Browser stops overpromising when Hermes has no tool injection point in the current turn.

### Live Tool Activity Strip
- Replaced raw `[tool]` markdown appended to assistant answers with a compact runtime Tool Activity Strip while Hermes streams.
- Added shared tool-activity helpers that categorize file/edit/terminal/browser/web/media/meta tool names, sanitize previews (secrets, long lines), and respect reduced-motion preferences.
- New `toolKind` CSS variants for file/edit/terminal/browser/web/media/meta, plus scan/stitch/cursor/reticle/orbit/pixel/stack keyframes for the strip animation.

### Lean chat mode (token budget)
- Made Fast mode strict opt-in: stored string values such as `"false"`/`"off"` no longer produce `model_options.fast: true` or priority service-tier requests.
- Hardened `buildHermesModelOptions` so `service_tier` and `fast` are only set when the user actually opts in.
- `normalizeFastMode` returns a real boolean, never a truthy string.

### Real runtime meter
- Promoted the runtime payload to a first-class UI meter (Model, Provider, Context, Live 1.24s) in the side panel.
- Added `applyTurnRuntimePayload()` plumbing on the chat path so the runtime meter reflects the actual server reply instead of local estimates.
- Session-list refresh no longer overwrites a just-confirmed runtime model/provider with stale session-history data.

### Model catalog + warnings
- Switched model discovery to prefer the connected Hermes API server's `/api/model/options` catalog before dashboard scraping, with session-history and dashboard fallbacks for older runtimes.
- Added a static context-length fallback for GPT-5.5 across known providers (openai-codex 272K, openrouter 1.05M) so picker context windows no longer say "unknown".
- Hardened `/api/model/options` to never call the slow `get_model_context_length` resolver in the per-model loop; provider-aware fallback only.

### Sharper diagnostics
- Hardened gateway diagnostics so upstream Hermes runtime/tool tracebacks show as connected-with-warning instead of mislabeling the whole Browser connection as unreachable.
- Added explicit classification for the known Python `NoneType`/`int()` traceback class, with guidance to inspect Hermes logs and run `hermes computer-use doctor` when computer-use/cua-driver appears in the stack.
- Wired `gpt-image-2-medium` (Codex auth) for the side panel image generator and refined `pairingFailureMessage` for unsupported runtimes.

### Browser behavior settings
- Folded browser-behavior switches (auto-name sessions, open tabs, page text, selection, panel residency) into intentional settings cards instead of loose checkbox rows.
- Side-panel CSS hardened: long tab labels, active-tab titles/URLs, pinned scope labels, and bottom model/context controls ellipsize inside narrow panels.
- Pinned tab/session titles are clipped before session creation so the API title limit is respected.

### Context scope / Chat only
- Chat only no longer creates a new session or message bucket. It preserves the active conversation scope while disabling page/tab/selection capture for the turn.
- Added a separate `previousConversationScope` so the session binding and the transcript key both follow the original tab, not the capture mode.
- Tab-attached panels still allow Include all tabs / Page only / per-tab IN-OUT prompt selection; Follow active tab and Unlock pinned tab are hidden when not relevant.
- Prompt-tab IN/OUT toggles preserve the internal tab-list `scrollTop` across rerenders.
- Pinning a tab fresh-fetches it via `chrome.tabs.get(id)` so stale tab snapshots can't cause weird pinning behavior.

### Composer / voice / attachments
- Voice dictation is capability-gated: Hermes STT when advertised, Browser speech fallback when supported, visible Hermes Voice Dictation extension tab when the side panel mic prompt is suppressed.
- Microphone permission help links directly to `chrome://settings/content/siteDetails?site=chrome-extension%3A%2F%2F<id>%2F`.
- Drag/drop attachments and clipboard image paste keep working with the new composer controls.
- Inline send button moved to the composer right edge next to the voice button; mic is hidden while a run is active.

### Build / packaging / version sync
- Bumped source, package, root manifest, built `dist/` manifest, and `build-info.json` for v0.1.8.
- The `scripts/check-manifest.mjs` verifier now fails if root manifest, `extension/manifest.json`, `dist/manifest.json`, or `package.json` are out of sync, preventing the v0.1.5 stale-version bug.
- Build metadata is stamped into every supported unpacked load root (root, `extension/`, `dist/`) so update checks see the same loaded commit.

### Tests / docs
- 139/139 tests passing in `npm run verify`.
- README refreshed for v0.1.8; remote API setup clarified; troubleshooting covers `/health` reachable + runtime warning, native computer-use, and Connect flow.
- Public release hygiene: docs are public-marketing only; private plans, internal notes, and release-prep docs are gitignored.

### Notes for v0.1.9
- Plan slot: public support and compatibility hardening. Old-Hermes-version guards, GitHub-label/Discord triage, compatibility matrix, copy-diagnostics UX, and a stable public support playbook.

## v0.1.7 — 2026-06-30

- Added tab-attached side panel opening by default, with a settings toggle to keep the panel global across tabs when preferred.
- Preserved tab-attached side panel paths for both supported load-unpacked roots: repo root and `dist/`/`extension/`.
- Added Chat only context scope so Hermes can run without reading the active tab, open tabs, selected text, page metadata, transcript, or page text.
- Made Chat only short-circuit before browser tab queries and isolated its local message cache from page-context conversations.
- Fixed selected-tab context accounting so the context meter and “What Hermes saw” receipt report tabs actually sent to Hermes, not just tabs open in the window.
- Fixed Remote API connection validation so trusted `http://host:8642` API servers work with a token while remote dashboard WebSocket mode stays HTTPS-only.
- Added `/rewrite` and `/action-items` to match the public docs, while keeping `/actions` reserved for listing interactive page elements.
- Preserved attachment context for slash-command turns, so commands like `/summarize` do not drop attached text/files.
- Updated public privacy, permissions, and data-flow docs for v0.1.7’s Chat only and tab-attached behavior.

## v0.1.6 — 2026-06-28

- Added built-in quick commands such as `/summarize`, `/explain`, `/rewrite`, `/tabs`, and `/action-items`, with slash dispatch and command suggestions in the side panel.
- Added a composer-header tab-context control so Hermes can follow the active tab or pin to a specific tab without adding extra lower composer chrome.
- Isolated pinned-tab conversations with per-tab local message caches and per-tab Hermes session bindings.
- Added selected-tab filtering for the open-tabs context list inside the same upward context card, including all/none controls.
- Added Desktop-style busy composer controls: typing during an active run now reveals separate Queue and Steer buttons, and queued messages expose Steer Now/Delete actions.
- Reworked unpacked-build update checks to compare the loaded build commit against GitHub main instead of mislabeling post-release commits as unpulled.
- Stamped build metadata into every supported unpacked load root so repo-root, `extension/`, and `dist/` installs can all verify commit alignment.
- Added privacy redaction for sensitive tab titles/URLs before prompt assembly, including restricted active tabs and open-tab summaries.
- Preserved contributor work from @iruzen-dono's quick-command and multi-tab context PRs, with follow-up hardening and tests.
- Deferred the broad optional-host-permissions migration to a later release so v0.1.6 does not change the permission surface while shipping context-control improvements.

## v0.1.5 — 2026-06-27

- Added a Hermes compatibility panel backed by `/v1/capabilities`, with legacy fallback when older gateways do not advertise feature support.
- Made first-run Connect avoid missing pairing routes: unsupported runtimes now go straight to Manual setup with Gateway URL/token guidance.
- Added capability-gated voice dictation: Hermes STT is used when advertised, otherwise the side panel and visible voice page use Browser speech fallback when available.
- Added token hygiene UI with masked token state, connection mode, last-tested timestamp, and one-click token clearing.
- Added a collapsible “What Hermes saw” receipt after each sent turn so users can inspect tab/context/attachment/redaction payloads.
- Gated image upload and profile APIs behind capabilities so missing routes become clear fallback warnings instead of broken UX.
- Added public permissions, data-flow, and privacy docs for shipped behavior.
- Clarified remote API setup so same-LAN `http://host:8642` works in Remote gateway mode when an API key is present, while dashboard WebSocket mode remains HTTPS-only.
- Documented how to reload/remove/reload unpacked when Chrome still shows an older extension version after update.

## v0.1.4 — 2026-06-26

- Added editable Hermes session titles, including first-message auto-naming for new Browser sessions.
- Reworked connection state so the side panel uses live gateway reachability instead of treating a saved API key as connected.
- Added commit-aware update checks for unpacked builds, including same-version "unpulled commits" guidance.
- Expanded agent discovery to trusted remote hosts while keeping bearer tokens off non-Hermes probe targets.
- Refined the default Nous palette toward the ink-blue/soft-white Desktop look.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-06-24

- Added drag/drop attachments directly into the composer, including PDFs and files.
- Added Stop and Queue Message controls while Hermes is responding.
- Added `/` and `@` skill command autocomplete backed by Hermes skills.
- Added Agent Profile settings section with graceful fallback for gateways without profile APIs.
- Replaced the large Refresh button with a compact refresh icon.
- Improved streaming completion handling so final answers replace partial deltas.

## v0.1.0-alpha — 2026-06-24

- First public alpha preparation for Hermes Browser Extension.
- Chrome/Edge MV3 side panel.
- Local Hermes Gateway/API connection.
- Active page context capture.
- Streaming response support with fallback.
- Read-only browser context model.
- Load-unpacked install path; not yet on the Chrome Web Store.
